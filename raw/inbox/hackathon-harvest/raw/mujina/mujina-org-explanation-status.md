# Where Mujina Is Today [](https://mujina.org#where-mujina-is-today)

Mujina is young software with a working core. This page sets out what works, what does not exist yet, and where the effort is going, so you can decide what to do with Mujina today: run it, build on it, or watch it and come back.

Current as of July 2026

This page tracks a moving project. [Follow the work](https://mujina.org#follow-the-work) lists where change shows up first.

## What works today [](https://mujina.org#what-works-today)

mujina-minerd is a complete miner: it connects to a Stratum v1 pool, negotiating version rolling, schedules jobs across hash threads, and submits shares. It drives real hardware end to end, using the single-chip [Bitaxe Gamma](https://mujina.org/reference/hardware-compatibility#bitaxe-gamma) as a developer-friendly hashboard, with temperature and hashrate monitoring and USB hotplug. There is also a CPU-based virtual hashboard, so the whole miner runs on a Linux machine with no mining hardware at all; [the tutorial](https://mujina.org/tutorial/first-run) has it working in about fifteen minutes. A REST API reports live state, can pause and resume mining, and serves its own Swagger UI. A published container image runs the daemon anywhere containers run.

## What does not exist yet [](https://mujina.org#what-does-not-exist-yet)

Anyone deciding whether to run Mujina should know these gaps up front:

- **Performance tuning.** There are no frequency, voltage, or power controls, and no autotuning.
- **Efficiency numbers.** The project has not measured or published J/TH figures on any board.
- **Load control and automation.** The API can pause and resume mining; it cannot yet set power targets, schedule boards, or work with home automation.
- **Pool failover.** The daemon connects to one pool at a time, and only over Stratum v1.
- **Turnkey installation.** There are no prebuilt images. Running Mujina means building from source or running the container, and installing it on a stock control board is an unsettled problem. The goal is Mujina OS: complete operating system images for control boards. None exist yet.

## Is Mujina for you yet? [](https://mujina.org#is-mujina-for-you-yet)

**Developers and tinkerers: yes, today.** The CPU backend puts the whole system on your machine in minutes, and the Bitaxe Gamma is cheap real hardware that works today. Start with [the tutorial](https://mujina.org/tutorial/first-run), then [join in](https://mujina.org/community).

**Home miners with S19-class machines: not yet as a firmware replacement.** S19-class support is prototype work in a fork.

**Mining operations: not yet.** Nothing here is production-grade for a fleet: no tuning, no published efficiency, no fleet management. Follow the project; do not deploy it yet.

## Where the work is going [](https://mujina.org#where-the-work-is-going)

[Why Mujina](https://mujina.org/explanation/why-mujina) states the aims. The work happening now:

- **S19-class support in mainline.** Making the prototype S19j/S19k Pro fork product-grade and merging it into mainline is a current focus.
- **EmberOne/00 bring-up.** Mainline support for the 256 Foundation's open hashboard is being reworked and is in progress.
- **Intel BZM2 drivers.** Work in progress lives on [johnny9's bonanza branch](https://github.com/johnny9/mujina/tree/bonanza).

The [compatibility matrix](https://mujina.org/reference/hardware-compatibility) records each board's status as this work moves.

## Follow the work [](https://mujina.org#follow-the-work)

Changes show up in the working channels first:

- [Dev call records](https://github.com/256foundation/mujina/discussions/categories/dev-calls): agendas and records of the regular contributor calls, the best summary of recent work.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/256foundation/mujina): commits, pull requests, and discussions.
- This page and the [matrix](https://mujina.org/reference/hardware-compatibility) carry "current as of" dates and are updated as things change.

If you looked at Mujina and decided "not yet", the dev call records and compatibility [matrix](https://mujina.org/reference/hardware-compatibility) are the cheapest way to check back without following day to day.
