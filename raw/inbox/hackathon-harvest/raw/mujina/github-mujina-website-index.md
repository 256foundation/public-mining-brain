      You bought the hardware, but closed firmware means someone else
      controls it. Mujina is GPL-licensed Rust you can read, audit,
      and change without permission.

## What is Mujina?

Mujina aims to be the Linux kernel of Bitcoin mining firmware: a
single open source codebase that drives mining hardware from any
vendor, maintained in the open by the people who use it. Today
Mujina is a daemon you build and run yourself. The goal is Mujina
OS: complete operating system images installed onto a miner's
control board.

[Why Mujina](/explanation/why-mujina) explains the thinking; [Your
First Run](/tutorial/first-run) shows it working on your computer in
minutes, no mining hardware required.
