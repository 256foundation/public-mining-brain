# Your First Run [](https://mujina.org#your-first-run)

In this tutorial you will build Mujina from source and run it as a complete miner, using your CPU in place of ASIC mining hardware. By the end you will have watched a complete miner work on your own machine: jobs flowing to hash threads, candidate shares coming back, and a live REST API reporting on all of it. You need no mining hardware and no pool account.

Expect about fifteen minutes, most of it compile time.

Current as of July 2026

Mujina changes quickly. The log lines and API output below were captured in July 2026 and may differ from what you see; the overall flow should not.

## Before you start [](https://mujina.org#before-you-start)

You need:

- A Linux machine. Mujina runs only on Linux.
- The Rust toolchain, installed with [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- Two build dependencies. On Debian or Ubuntu:

`sudo apt install libudev-dev libssl-dev`
## Get the source [](https://mujina.org#get-the-source)

Clone the repository and enter it:

```
git clone https://github.com/256foundation/mujina.git
cd mujina
```
## Start the miner [](https://mujina.org#start-the-miner)

Start the daemon with the CPU backend enabled:

```
MUJINA_CPUMINER_THREADS=2 \
MUJINA_USB_DISABLE=1 \
  cargo run --release --bin mujina-minerd
```
The first build takes a few minutes. Then the miner starts and prints lines like these:

```
16:13:58 INFO  daemon: USB discovery disabled (MUJINA_USB_DISABLE set)
16:13:58 INFO  daemon: CPU miner enabled
               threads=2, duty=50
16:13:58 INFO  daemon: Using dummy job source (set MUJINA_POOL_URL to use Stratum v1)
16:13:58 INFO  backplane: CPU miner board connected.
               board=CPU Miner, threads=2, duty=50
16:13:58 INFO  daemon: Started.
16:13:58 INFO  api::server: API server listening.
               url=http://127.0.0.1:7785
```
Read the log from the top. The two variables you set enabled the CPU mining backend with two hashing threads and skipped the search for USB hardware. With no pool configured, the miner started its built-in dummy job source, which generates synthetic work so the hash threads have something to mine. A virtual "CPU Miner" board connected, just as an ASIC board would. The REST API came up.

You are now mining. Not profitably: your CPU does a few megahashes a second; an ASIC does terahashes. But every part of Mujina that would drive real hardware is running.

Leave the miner running. About every half minute it reports:

```
16:15:25 INFO  scheduler: Mining status.
               uptime=30s, hashrate=5.2 MH/s, shares=0
```
## Watch the miner work [](https://mujina.org#watch-the-miner-work)

The default log level stays quiet between status reports. Stop the miner with Ctrl+C, and restart it with debug logging:

```
MUJINA_CPUMINER_THREADS=2 \
MUJINA_USB_DISABLE=1 \
MUJINA_LOG=debug \
  cargo run --release --bin mujina-minerd
```
Now the log shows each step as it happens:

```
16:14:55 DEBUG scheduler: Thread registered
               thread=CPU Core 0
16:14:55 DEBUG cpu_miner::hasher: Share found
16:14:55 DEBUG scheduler: Share found
               source=dummy, job_id=dummy-0, nonce=0x127eb,
               hash=00004d313bd03f2d5971d0f7cd4ca965..., share_difficulty=0.0000506,
               threshold=2.33K
```
Each `Share found` pair is a hash thread turning up a candidate nonce, which the scheduler checks against the job's share threshold. At CPU speed, candidates that clear a real threshold are rare; that is why the status line's `shares` count stays at zero while the hash threads keep working.

## Query the miner's API [](https://mujina.org#query-the-miner-s-api)

The daemon serves a REST API while it runs. From a second terminal:

`curl http://127.0.0.1:7785/api/v0/health``OK`
The full state snapshot lives at `/api/v0/miner`, with subtrees at `/api/v0/boards` and `/api/v0/sources`. Browse them all in the Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:7785/swagger-ui`, which the daemon serves from its own OpenAPI spec.

## Stop the miner [](https://mujina.org#stop-the-miner)

Press Ctrl+C in the miner's terminal. The daemon shuts down cleanly and reports its final status before exiting:

```
16:15:40 INFO  daemon: Received SIGTERM.
16:15:40 INFO  scheduler: Mining status.
               uptime=44s, hashrate=4.9 MH/s, shares=1
16:15:40 INFO  daemon: Exiting.
```
## What you've built [](https://mujina.org#what-you-ve-built)

You have run the entire Mujina stack: daemon, scheduler, a mining backend, a job source, and the API, on nothing but a CPU. This was not a simulation; it was the real miner. Attach an ASIC board and the same daemon runs the same way. Only the hashrate changes: about a million times faster.
